### About Me 📖
As a member of the Computer Science Student Community [(CSSC)](https://cssc.utm.utoronto.ca/), I want to create a welcoming computer science environment by providing students access to any information they need. Using my experience as a TA and my passion for learning, I grab any information within my reach and pass them on to people who need it. In my spare time, I enjoy knitting and taking long walks in Skyrim.

### What I'm playing 🎮
🐲 Skyrim  
🍑 Super Princess Peach DS  
🔷 Set with Friends (Challenge me if you can)
